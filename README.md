This library of movies contains 3 views: a homepage which is an inventory of movies added, a form page on which the user can add a new movie, and a details page which includes a description of the movie.  When a user clicks the add button on the homepage, it navigates to the form, where a user can add a movie with a poster URL, a description, and can select a genre.  The user can save the selection and it will print to the homepage as well as store to the database.  Or, the user can cancel the selection which will kick them back to the homepage.  The user can click on a movie poster on the homepage, which brings them to the details page for that movie.
