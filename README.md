My Library of Movies

## Description

This application is a library of movies.  The home page is a list of movies that the user can add to by clicking a button that will navigate to a form.  On that form the user can input a new title, a poster url, a description of the movie, and select a genre.  The form allows the user to save the selection, which will save it in the database and print it to the homepage.  The user can also cancel the selection which will navigate them back to the homepage.  On the homepage, the posters for the movies can be clicked to switch the user over to a description page which contains the summary and genre of the movie.
